I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Professor Peter Stone's Learning Agents Research Group (LARG) at UT Austin. Before my current position, I obtained my master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Edinburgh, where I was a member of the Autonomous Agents Research group headed by Dr. Stefano Albrecht. I am originally from Indonesia and lived there until I obtained my undergraduate degree from Universitas Indonesia.

As real-world deployments of AI agents increase across organizations, my research aims to ensure their safe coexistence with humans and other AI agents by advancing the theoretical and practical understanding of human-AI coordination, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), open-ended learning, and game theory. With a proven track record of securing substantial research funding and producing impactful research, I aim to contribute to the research of a leading research institution. I aim to lead projects that integrate multi-agent reinforcement learning and game-theoretic principles to deepen our theoretical understanding of cooperative intelligence, while developing beneficial interactive AI systems for real-world domains.

I am currently exploring open-ended learning methods to continuously generate a stream of teammate policies that highlight the trained agent's cooperative weaknesses and lead it to improve its collaborative capabilities through interactions with them. Furthermore, my research is also interested in developing agent modeling and reasoning techniques that enable LLM-based agents to be effective partners for teammates with diverse goals and beliefs. If you are also interested in this area of research, please do not hesitate to contact me.
