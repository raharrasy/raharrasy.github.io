I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Professor Peter Stone's Learning Agents Research Group (LARG) at UT Austin. Prior to my current position, I obtained my masters and doctorate degree from the University of Edinburgh, where I was a member of the Autonomous Agents Research group headed by Dr. Stefano Albrecht. Originally, I was born in Indonesia and lived there until I obtained my undergraduate degree from Universitas Indonesia. 

My research interests broadly encompass game theory, reinforcement learning, transfer learning and graph neural networks. I am specifically interested in their application in the ad hoc teamwork (AHT) problem, which explores techniques to create autonomous agents that can quickly adapt their policies to optimally interact with previously unseen teammate policies and team configurations. Through my research, my long-term goal is to build intelligent agents that can collaborate on-the-fly with humans to help them solve various collaborative decision-making problems encountered in their daily lives.

At the moment, I am exploring methods to generate a diverse population of teammate policies that can be utilized to train robust agents capable of optimally collaborating against different teammate policies. My belief is the trained agent's robustness can be maximized if we design a population of teammate policies requiring the trained agent to play distinct best-response policies. If you are also interested in this area of research, please do not hesitate to contact me.
